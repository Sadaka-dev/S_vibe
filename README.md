# Mohamed Sadaka — Personal Portfolio (Single Page)

This repository is a minimal, responsive single-page portfolio for Mohamed Sadaka, built with semantic HTML, Tailwind CSS (Play CDN), and vanilla JavaScript.

Features
- Dark-mode-first design with a light/dark toggle
- Sticky navigation with smooth scrolling and mobile hamburger menu
- Typewriter animation in the hero headline
- Scroll animations using IntersectionObserver
- Responsive layout and micro-interactions
- Placeholder projects, skills, experience, and contact sections

How to use
1. Clone or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser. (Tailwind Play CDN is used, so no build step is required.)
3. To use a build-based Tailwind workflow (optional), replace Play CDN with a standard Tailwind setup and build pipeline.

Files
- `index.html` — main single-page app
- `scripts/main.js` — all vanilla JavaScript interactivity
- `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`

Customization suggestions
- Replace placeholder project content and links with real project pages & repos.
- Swap the Tailwind Play CDN for a local build process if you need purging and production optimization.
- Add analytics, contact forms, or backend endpoints for contact messages.
